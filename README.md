# Express-App

This is a backend application I created so that you can select different workout for each day and customize the weight and reps. I used MongoDB, Express, Mongoose and Handelbars to develop this and deployed it using heroku! To view the app you can visit https://fitness-planner-gls.herokuapp.com/ 

## Technology Used:

- MongoDB
